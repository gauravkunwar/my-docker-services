```

To stop and remove all containers, volumes, and networks:

```sh

```

## ðŸ›  Maintenance

### Update Containers

Watchtower is configured to automatically update the containers daily at 2AM. However, you can manually update them with:

```sh
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

### Check Logs

You can check logs for a specific container:

```sh
docker logs -f homeassistant
```

Or check logs for all containers:

```sh
docker-compose logs -f
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Notes

- This setup assumes that your `$HOME_DIR` is correctly set in the `.env` file.
- Some services require additional configuration through their web UI after initial setup.
- Ensure that you change default passwords and secrets in your `.env` file before running the setup.
